                <p>Families, caregivers, charities and research groups across the United States observe September
                as Childhood Cancer Awareness Month.
                In the U.S., 15,780 children under the age of 21 are diagnosed with cancer every year;
                approximately 1/4 of them will not survive the disease. A diagnosis turns the lives of the entire family upside down.
                The objective of Childhood Cancer Awareness Month is to put a spotlight
                on the types of cancer that largely affect children, survivorship issues,
                sand – importantly – to help raise funds for research and family support.
