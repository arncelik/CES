            <h3 class="dark">Who we are</h3>
            <p class="dark">The Cancer Epigenetics Society was founded in 2016, opening its doors
              to the public on April 21.We are headquaretered in the historical 1st district of Vienna,
              Australia home to University of Vienna, 15 Nobel prize laureates,
              and to some of the most influential minds of all times.
              We believe that discoveries can be made and brought to clinic much faster through international collaboration,
              and we therefore serve all nationalities and geographical areas without restriction(we currently serve members in 125 countries)
              You can learn more about us and about cancer epigenetics by
              exploring all the features in this and other areas of the Society's web portal.
            </p>
            <h3 class="dark">Our Main Goal</h3>
            <p class="dark">
              For many cancer patients time is of the essence.
                Despite its promises, the field of cancer epigenetics has been slow
                in translating its findings into tangible clinical applications.
                As a case in point, 5-azacytidine, an epigenetic drug shown to more than double
                survival of mice with lukemia.Our ultimate goal is to bring together patients and their families
                scientits, oncologists, and other helahtcare providers adn policy makers to advance and publize knowledge,
                expedite discovery, and streamline clinical findings in cancer epigenetics to benefit patients as fast as possible.

            <h3>What We Do</h3>
            <p>The Cancer Epigenetics Society focuses on cancer epigenetics as all indications point to this field as one of the most
            promising research fields, at the bench and bedside alike.</p>
